# Reconnect Mod: Reloaded
A simple mod that supersedes HiWord9's Reconnect Button mod, updated to support 1.21! This mod adds a reconnect button on your in-game menu screen while in a Multiplayer world.

## Currently supports Fabric 1.21. There are no current plans of porting this mod to other modloaders like Forge, but will be considered if there is demand.
